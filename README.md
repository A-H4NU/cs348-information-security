# CS348: Introduction to Information Security

This is the Github repository for CS348 at KAIST.


## Homework
This course includes written and programming assignments.
Students will use a few tools which are described below.

### Git, Github, and Github Classroom
We will use Github/Github Classroom to provide assignment templates and manage submissions.
Make sure you have a Github account and get the [student developer pack benefits](https://education.github.com/pack).
Moreover, student should get familiar with `git`.
If you are new to `git`, see this [book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2).

All submissions will be managed using Github. For each assignment, a unique invitation URL for Github Classroom will be posted in the Classum web board.
Once you accept the invitation, a private repository for your assignment will be created.
You can push as many commits as you want before the deadline. We will grade the final commit of your `master` branch.


### OCaml
Students will use the [OCaml](https://ocaml.org) programming language for the software security assignments. For more details of OCaml, see the following meterials:
