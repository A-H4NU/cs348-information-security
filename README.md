# CS348: Introduction to Information Security

This is the Github repository for CS348 at KAIST.


## Homework
This course includes written and programming assignments.
Students will use a few tools which are described [here](TOOL.md).

All submissions will be managed using Github.
For each assignment, a unique invitation URL for Github Classroom will be posted in the Classum web board.
Once you accept the invitation, a private repository for your assignment will be created.
You can push as many commits as you want before the deadline. We will grade the final commit of your `master` branch.
