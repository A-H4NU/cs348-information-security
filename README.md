# CS448: Introduction to Information Security

This is the Github repository for CS448 at KAIST.

## Homework
This course includes programming assignments through which students will learn how to design and implement dynamic and static program analyzers.

- We will use Github/Github Classroom to provide skeleton code and manage submissions.
Make sure you have a Github account and get the [student developer pack benefits](https://education.github.com/pack).
Moreover, student should get familiar with `git`.
If you are new to `git`, see this [book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2).
All submissions will be managed using Github.
For each assignment, a unique invitation URL for Github Classroom will be posted in this page.
Once you accept the invitation, a private repository for your assignment will be created.
You can push as many commits as you want before the deadline. We will grade the final commit of your `master` branch.
The late homework policy is as follows:
  - 80% credit for one day late
  - 50% credit for two days late
  - NO credit given after two days late

- Students will use the [OCaml](https://ocaml.org) programming language for the assignments. For more details of OCaml, see the following meterials:
  - [Real World OCaml](https://dev.realworldocaml.org/index.html)
  - [Commercial Users of Functional Programming](http://cufp.org/2017)

- Students will use the [LLVM](https://llvm.org) infrastructure and implement various tools that analyze programs written in LLVM IR code.
LLVM IR code can be generated from many source languages such as C/C++/Obj-C, Swift, Rust, Scala, Haskell, etc.
For more details of LLVM, see this [document](https://llvm.org/docs).
